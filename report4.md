Keys pressed: `<s> <s> <h> <space> <g> <c> <a> <r> <d> <e> <n> <a> <s> <o> <r> <t> <i> <z> <@> <i> <e> <n> <g> <6> <.> <u> <c> <s> <d> <.> <e> <d> <u> <enter>`

The command ran was `ssh` which allows me to remotely access a server, in this case allowing me to login to my `ieng6` account so I can proceed with the rest of the steps.

## Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

Keys pressed:  `<command + c> <g> <i> <t> <space> <c> <l> <o> <n> <e> <command + v>`

First, I used `<command + c>` to copy the ssh key from github then `<command + v>` to paste the key to use with the `git clone` command. This command clones the repository to my machine for my use.
