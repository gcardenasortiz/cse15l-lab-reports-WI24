Keys pressed: `<s> <s> <h> <space> <g> <c> <a> <r> <d> <e> <n> <a> <s> <o> <r> <t> <i> <z> <@> <i> <e> <n> <g> <6> <.> <u> <c> <s> <d> <.> <e> <d> <u> <enter>`

The command ran was `ssh` which allows me to remotely access a server, in this case allowing me to login to my `ieng6` account so I can proceed with the rest of the steps.

## Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

Keys pressed:  `<command + c> <g> <i> <t> <space> <c> <l> <o> <n> <e> <space> <command + v> <enter>`

First, I used `<command + c>` to copy the `ssh` key from github then `<command + v>` to paste the key to use with the `git clone` command. This command clones the repository to my machine for my use.

## Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys pressed: `<c> <d> <space> <l> <a> <b> <7> <enter> <b> <a> <s> <h> <space> <t> <e> <s> <t> <.> <s> <h> <enter>`

The command `cd` allows me to switch into the repository that we cloned. Once I was in the `lab7` directory, I run the command `bash` which runs the shell script that contains the commands to run the tests. However, the test fails due to a bug.


## Edit the code file to fix the failing test

The command `vim` opens up the text editor so once I use that command on the file I want to modify, it will open it and I will be able to modify it. Once I am in the `vim` editor, I use the `?` `vim` command which searches the document from back to front since the word I am looking for `index1` is in the back of the code. Once I press enter, it takes me straight to the word where I use the `i` `vim` command to enter 

## Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
