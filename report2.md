Both methods, handleRequest and my main method, were called. My code only needs two separate arguments to work properly, the first argument in this case is the url `localhost:1600/add-message?s=Hello&user=Me`. The second argument is for my main method when I run my server. When I run it by typing `java ChatServer 1600` in the terminal, the argument is the 1600 contained in `args` which states what port it will use. Before this request is sent through, the field `str` is an empty string as `""`. However, after it is sent through `str` becomes `"Me: Hello\n".`

The working directory at the time was `/home`. As you can see the reason that we got that output is become when the `cd` command is run, it returns to `/home`. As such, it is not an error.
